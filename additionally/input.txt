ACT I
Scene 1
A Room of State in King Lear's Palace.
[Enter Kent, Gloster, and Edmund.]
Kent.
I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than
Cornwall.
Glou.
It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the
kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for
equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make
choice of either's moiety.
Kent.
Is not this your son, my lord?
Glou.
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often
blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't.
